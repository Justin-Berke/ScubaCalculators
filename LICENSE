1) Scuba diving is a dangerous activity with inherent risks of death and serious 
injury. No person should attempt scuba diving without professional training, 
certification, supervision and regular medical assessment. It is also dangerous 
for trained scuba divers to exceed the limitations of their training. Diving 
at altitudes above sea level, and breathing mixed gases other than air, carry 
increased risk and additional types of risk. Divers should seek additional, 
professional training and certification for such activities.

These tools are intended for reference use only. The tools and code are not 
designed for use in scuba diving and related activities, and are emphatically 
not suitable for use in actual dive planning. Always refer to officially 
recognized, verified diving tables from your certifying agency before 
participating in a properly planned scuba diving session.

The software will yield numerical results intended to aid dive planning 
activities. The results have not been verified by a certified diving physician 
for accuracy. It is possible that the results from these tool can lead to 
serious injury or death if used inappropriately.

The tools should not be used to generate diving tables or protocols related to 
diving. No output from this software should be misconstrued as a diving table. 
Only persons qualified to supervise diving activities or qualified in hyperbaric 
medicine should attempt to design diving tables.

The author does not warrant that the output is correct in any sense whatsoever. 
Even if correctly computed, the output from these tools shall in no way be used 
in final dive plans.
